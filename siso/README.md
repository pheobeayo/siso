# ZapBase

## Overview

[Siso]() enables users to **initiate Ethereum transactions** using **voice commands**. The system integrates a smart contract that maps **basenames** (e.g., `alice.base.eth`) to wallet addresses, enabling secure and seamless voice-triggered asset transfers aligned with the theme of **Next Generation of Autonomous Businesses**. Our focus is on leveraging AI and blockchain technologies to create impactful and scalable solutions.
This application enables users to:

- 🎤 **Use voice commands** like “Send 0.01 ETH to jane.base.eth”  
- 💸 **Trigger on-chain ETH transactions**  
- 🔗 Interact with a smart contract for name-to-address resolution

## Getting Started

###
Access the Telegram bot [here](https://t.me/myUXCrushbot)

To check the app is running, you can ping: you will get the response `Bot is running.`

### Basename Resolution Smart Contract

A Solidity smart contract that stores and resolves basenames to Ethereum addresses.

### 

```solidity
mapping(string => address) public nameToAddress;

function getAddress(string memory name) public view returns (address);
```

### Voice-Driven Transaction Flow

1. User speaks:  
   “Send 0.02 ETH to jane”

2. Frontend captures and sends:

   ```
   {
     "basename": "jane.base.eth",
     "amount": "0.02"
   }
   ```
3. Backend (`/send` endpoint):
   - Uses `web.js` to interact with` SC` to resolve `jane.base.eth → 0xReceiver`
   - Calls `sendAsset("0xReceiver", "0.02")`
   - Responds with transaction hash

Voice recognition is handled externally (e.g., browser or mobile), with text commands sent to this backend for blockchain execution.
### Project Goals
- Develop an **AI-powered autonomous agent** as the core of our solution.
- Ensure deployment on **Base** with on-chain execution where applicable.


### Steps of Action

1. **Research & Ideation**: Explore the problem space and finalize our project idea.
2. **Development**: Build the AI agent and integrate it with blockchain components.
3. **Testing & Deployment**: Ensure functionality and deploy on Base.
4. **Submission**: Prepare the required materials (demo, repository, pitch deck).
